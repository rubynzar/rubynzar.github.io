  <h2>Teachers, help responsible resource management!</h2>

  <p>Teachers have a very important role for the future of humanity.
     Raising awareness towards forest exploitation plays a critical part in sustaining our future.
      Teach them about responsible resource management and integrate the issue in an attractive way to your
       students so future generation will still have a habitable planet.
     </p>

  <h2>Parents, help responsible resource management!</h2>

  <p>
    Parents always do only the best for their children but it is time to also do the best for both short-term and long-term future.
    The responsible management of forests directly impact the well-being of the children who will have to face the consequences  of
     our present immorality. Integrate the issue in an attractive way to your children so they and their future generation
     may get the chance to enjoy a healthy life.
